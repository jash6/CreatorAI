# CreatorAI

CreatorAI leverages a combination of data scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to build a conversational AI that closely resembles the digital persona of content creators. By capturing the tone, language style, and unique attributes of influencers, the bot aims to create an engaging and personalized experience for their audience.

## RAG Integration
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is at the heart of CreatorAI's intelligent responses. The system combines a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant information from the creator's content with a generative model to produce human-like replies. This hybrid approach ensures that the bot maintains accuracy and fluency in conversations.

### How RAG Works
1. **Retrieve**: The bot searches through indexed data (e.g., past videos, comments) to find the most relevant content related to the user's query.
2. **Generate**: The generative model fine-tunes the response, ensuring it aligns with the creator's tone and personality.
